### Problem Statement 🤔:
* ### Theme: Food Security Through Soil Health
* Participants can identify the factors of soil health and biodiversity loss such as land-change, land degradation, pollution, unsustainable farming, wild fires etc.  The challenge to protect, manage and restore soil health, and reap the ecosystem service benefits. These soil characteristics in the peri-urban areas that can create new business models with agro-forestry,  and agro-tourism.
### Motivation
* Food Insecurity constitute 189.2 Million people  of the indian population and major cause for fatal mal nutrition.
* 20% children under 5 are underweight. 
* 34.7% children under 5 are stunted.
* 51.4% women in the reproductive age (15 - 49) are anemic
* Lack of a regulatory body that suggests individual farmers to go with the crop choices that ensures both agricultural productivity and food security of a region.
### Our Solution 👨‍💻:


* A Data-Driven Evaluatory Model that analyses the vitals of a particular region and quantifies it based on its Food  Insecurity Level.
* A Suggestive Model that takes into consideration various factors of Crop Diversity of a region and suggests the best fit crop for cultivation
